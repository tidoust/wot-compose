        This document proposes the basis of a common model to describe the virtual counterpart of physical objects in
        the Web of Things.
        It defines a model and Web API for Things to be followed by anyone wanting to create a product, device, service,
        or application for the Web of Things. This document considers the definition of the Web of Things (WoT) proposed
        in [[WoTPaper]] and [[WoTBook]], i.e., the Application layer of the Internet of Things. The model and
        protocols proposed here aim at making the interaction between Things in the Internet of Things accessible
        through Web standards to facilitate the implementation of Web applications making use or retrieving data from
        real-world objects.
    </p>

        This document is intended to be submitted as a W3C Member Submission and is based on work undertaken within the
        <a href="http://www.compose-project.eu/">COMPOSE</a> European project.

<section class='informative'>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        The following guidelines and recommendations aim at ensuring interoperability across all entities on the Web of
        Things. Unlike other custom (non-Web) protocols used for machine-to-machine communications that create a
        “parallel universe” to the existing Web; the Web of Things as described here is designed to be seamlessly
        integrated to the existing Web so it can fully leverage its infrastructure and standards to minimize
        integrations across applications and systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        The proposal is composed of three sub-parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Integration Patterns</strong>. This section discusses the way Things are integrated to the Web. It
            proposes 3 different patterns, Direct Connectivity, Gateway Based Connectivity, Cloud Based Connectivity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web Things (WT) Requirements</strong>. This part does not introduce any specific data naming
            conventions of domain-specific models. It is solely composed of multiple constraints and recommendations on
            how the protocol should be implemented so that any entity on the Web of Things can easily interact with each
            other. Respecting these requirements turns a Web server into a Web Thing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web Things Model</strong>. Once a Web Thing follows the conventions defined above, it is then
            capable to read and exchange data with any other entities of the Web of Things. However, it does not mean it
            can “understand” what the object is, what data or services it offers, etc. Therefore, the second component
            of this specification proposes RESTful Web protocol with a set of resources, data models, payload syntax and
            semantic extensions that Web Thing and applications should follow. Respecting these requirements turns a Web
            Thing into an Extended Web Thing. Implementing semantic extensions (via JSON-LD) turns the Extended Web
            Thing into a Semantic Web Thing.
        </li>
    </ul>

    </figure>
</section>

<section id='conformance'>
    <p>
        This specification has two classes of products:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Web Thing</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A virtual representation of a physical object (a Thing) accessible on the Web via a REST API. Examples of
            Web Things are: an Arduino board, a garage door, a bottle of soda, a building, a TV, etc. The API of the Web
            Thing can be hosted on the Thing itself or on an intermediate host in the network such as a Gateway or a
            Cloud service (for Things that aren't accessible through the Internet).
        </dd>
        <p>
            A <a>Web Thing</a> conforms to this specification if it follows the statements defined in <a
                href="#web-things-requirements"></a>.
        </p>
        <dt><dfn>Extended Web Thing</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A <a>Extended Web Thing</a> that also supports the REST API and data model defined in this specification,
            thus enabling its automatic inclusion in more complex systems.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        An <a>Extended Web Thing</a> conforms to this specification if it follows the statements defined in <a
            href="#web-things-requirements"></a> and <a href="#web-things-model"></a>.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>
        The following terms are considered in this proposal:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Client</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A <a>Client</a> refers to any physical or digital entity that can interact with a Web Thing. This can be a
            mobile application, a Web browser, a proxy, a desktop application, but also another Web Things (e.g., in the
            case of Machine to Machine communication).
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>Property</dfn>
        <dt>
        <dd>A <a title="property">Property</a> is a set of values that reflect the current (and possibly
            future/historical) state of a <a>Web Thing</a>. Properties are "variables" about the Web Thing. Clients can
            subscribe to properties to receive a notification message when specific conditions are met (e.g. value of
            one or more properties changed).
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>Action</dfn></dt>
        <dd><a title="action">Actions</a> are requests that an external entity can send to a <a>Web Thing</a>, which may
            or may not change the internal state of the <a>Web Thing</a>. This is used mainly to send commands or
            notifications to a physical object. Examples of Actions are “open” or “close” for a garage door, “enable” or
            “disable” for a smoke alarm, “check-in” or “scan” for a bottle of soda or a place. The direction of an <a>Action</a>
            is from the <a>Client</a> to the <a>Web Thing</a>.
        </dd>

        </dt>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Web Things integration patterns</h2>

    <p>
        This part looks into the different ways of integrating physical objects to the Web to make them <a
            title="Web Thing">Web Things</a>. Once a pattern has been choosen, the server of a <a>Web Thing</a> should
        follow the <a href="#web-things-requirements">Web Things Requirements</a> and the resources and payloads it uses
        should follow the <a href="#web-things-model">Web Things Model</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some physical entities might not expose a Web API themselves for various reasons (e.g., a ZigBee sensor node, or
        an heart rate monitor accessible over Bluetooth only), in which case they are not <a title="Web Thing">Web
        Things</a> as such, but they can use another <a>Web Thing</a> as a proxy or gateway to provide a Web API for
        them, therefore turning them into Web Things.
    </p>

    <p>
        While the three integration patterns described below need to be taken into account it is worth noting that the
        requirements and model apply regardless of the integration pattern of choice.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Direct connectivity</h2>

        <p>
            In the most straightforward case, a <a>Web Thing</a> is simply a Web API that <a title="Client">Clients</a>
            send requests to. In some cases, the <a>Client</a> and the <a>Web Thing</a> can be on the same network or on
            different networks. In both cases, you are sending the same request to a <a>Web Thing</a>, the only
            difference is the URL to which you are sending the request (and obviously how the lamp gets the message).
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="integration-direct.png"
                 alt="When a Web Thing exposes a Web API, Clients can directly connect to it, potential through a local address if they are both on the same network"
                 width="800"/>
            <figcaption>Direct connectivity between a Client and a Web Thing</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Gateway-based connectivity</h2>

        <p>
            Gateway based connectivity is used when a Thing cannot offer a Web API directly. In this case an
            intermediate, the gateway, exposes a Web API on its behalf, therefore acting as a proxy (or gateway
            depending on the complexity/layer of the translation).
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="integration-gateways.png"
                 alt="When a Web Thing cannot expose a Web API directly, Clients connect to it through a Gateway that exposes the Web API on their behalf"
                 width="800"/>
            <figcaption>Gateway-based connectivity between a Client and a Web Thing</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Cloud-based connectivity</h2>

        <p>
            This third case is similar to <a href="#gateway-based-connectivity"></a>. However, in this case the gateway
            is a cloud service and not another device in situ.
        </p>

                 alt="A cloud service may expose the Web API of a Web Thing for Clients to connect to it" width="800"/>
            <figcaption>Cloud-based connectivity between a Client and a Web Thing</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </section>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Web Things requirements</h2>

    <p>
        This part defines a set of rules for implementing <a title="Web Thing">Web Things</a>. It assumes that an <a
            href="#web-things-integration-pattern">Integration Pattern</a> was chosen.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h2>Level 0 – MUST</h2>

        <p>
            This section defines the Level 0 requirements – all of which MUST be in place in any <a>Web Thing</a>
            implementation, as all <a title="Client">Clients</a> will expect these constraints.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h2>R0.1 – A <a>Web Thing</a> MUST at least be an HTTP/1.1 server</h2>

            <p>
                All <a title="Web Thing">Web Things</a> MUST support communication over HTTP/1.1 [[!RFC2616]]. When
                possible, <a title="Web Thing">Web Things</a> SHOULD also support HTTP/2 [[!RFC7540]].
            </p>

            <p class="note">
                HTTP/1.1 is the most widely spread protocol over the Web and virtually any HTTP client or server
                implementation supports it, therefore it is likely that the majority of clients might not support HTTP/2
                as of yet. This can be implemented directly on the <a>Web Thing</a> or can be provided via a proxy (see
                Integration Patterns).
            </p>

            <p class="note">
                As a consequence, while <a title="Client">Clients</a> should not expect support for HTTP/2,
                communication with a <a>Web Thing</a> using HTTP/1.1 is always possible.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>R0.2 – A <a>Web Thing</a> MUST have a root resource accessible via an HTTP URL</h2>

            <p>
                A <a>Web Thing</a> MUST have a so-called “root resource” identified by a HTTP URL (uses the HTTP
                protocol, therefore starts with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>) that acts as the entry
                point for the <a>Web Thing</a> and enables the interaction with it. This root resource makes the <a>Web
                Thing</a> both uniquely identifiable and addressable over a network so that <a
                    title="Client">Clients</a> can interact with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the <a>Web Thing</a> is a device connected on a LAN (e.g. a printer, a lamp, etc.), the root URL of a
                <a>Web Thing</a> SHOULD be its IP address and standard HTTP port, so that, knowing only the IP address
                of a networked device that is a <a>Web Thing</a>, a <a>Client</a> can send an HTTP GET request on that
                IP address over the default port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) to retrieve a representation of the Web
                Thing. This feature is envisioned to facilitate discovery of devices at the network level, without
                requiring an additional protocol.
            </p>

            <p class="note">
                A <a>Web Thing</a> does not need to be publicly accessible over the Internet, as some Web of Things
                scenarios might only work within a local area network (LAN) as defined above. This means a root URL does
                not need to be public and can be simply the local IP address of a device. The Root URL of a Web Thing is
                referred to as {wt} throughout this document.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>R0.3 – A <a>Web Thing</a> MUST support <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code>
                HTTP verbs</h2>

            <p>
                The Web of Things aims to maximise interoperability by exposing the services of Things using REST
                [[REST]]. For this idea to come to reality, supporting certain HTTP verbs of the specification is
                required. Considering that the REST paradigm is based on resources and <abbr
                    title="Create, Read, Update and Delete">CRUD</abbr> operations on them, a <a>Web Thing</a> MUST
                support <code>GET</code> for reading operations, <code>POST</code> for creation, <code>PUT</code> for
                updates and state changes, and <code>DELETE</code> for removal.
            </p>

            <p class="note">
                If possible the use of <code>PUT</code> and <code>PATCH</code> in addition to <code>POST</code> should
                be used for changing the value of a <a>Property</a> or sending an <a>Action</a> to the <a>Web Thing</a>.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>R0.4 – A <a>Web Thing</a> MUST implement HTTP status codes <code>200</code>, <code>400</code>,
                <code>500</code></h2>

            <p>
                Proper usage of HTTP/1.1 error codes is advisable. However, considering that some devices are
                restricted, only the following subset is mandatory:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2XX Success</strong>. Returned for any successful action. The <a>Web Thing</a> MUST at least
                    support the 200 OK response.
                </li>

            <h2>R0.5 – A <a>Web Thing</a> MUST support JSON as default representation</h2>

            <p>
                A <a>Web Thing</a> MUST always accept a valid JSON document [[!RFC7159]] as payload for request and
                always return a JSON representation when requested. If no <code>Accept:</code> HTTP header is specified
                in the request (or if the format is unknown or not supported), the <a>Web Thing</a> SHOULD return an
                appropriate error code, but it also MAY return JSON as default. Fields in JSON objects should follow the camelCase convention starting with a lowerCase letter (e.g., backColor) or a special character (e.g., _customRealtion).
            </p>

            <p>
                A <a>Web Thing</a> MAY support additional formats.
            </p>

            <p class="note">
                A consequence of supporting JSON is that UTF-8 is the default encoding for payloads (see <a

            <p>
                Ideally, <a>Web Thing</a> SHOULD support secure connections with HTTP over TLS [[!RFC5246]]. The ideal
                case for security is to support only HTTP over TLS. <a>Web Thing</a> that are exposed on the Internet

        <h2>Values</h2>

        <p>
            Several resources support values (particularly <a title="Action">Actions</a> and <a title="Property">Properties</a>).
            A <code>values</code> object contains the description of a set of values identified by their name. The
            description includes the value type, unit, and possible concrete values that the value can take. A <code>values</code>
            object is typically used to define the parameters a <a>Client</a> can use when it issues an <a>Action</a> or
            accesses the channels of a <a>Property</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following fields MAY be used to describe a value:

        <p>
            The value name <code>timestamp</code> is reserved. An <a>Extended Web Thing</a> MUST append a <code>timestamp</code>
            set to the current date and time whenever it creates a value unless that <code>timestamp</code> is already
            provided. The <code>timestamp</code> field follows the ISO8601 notation [[!ISO8601]]. The
            <code>createdAt</code> is different from <code>timestamp</code> because it used to refer when a resource has
            been created (server side information only), whereas the <code>timestamp</code> indicates when a value
            (property) has been measured (by the client or the Web Thing).

                        The <code>Location</code> URL returned in the 201 response seems wrong: that URL already existed
                        before the request so has not been created. That should rather be <code>{wt}/properties/temperature/{someid}</code>
                        if we want to expose the URL or we should use a <code>PUT</code> request.
